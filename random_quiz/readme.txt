MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED:

1. The function getRandomQuestion() is able to randomise the questions. It however is not
preventing questions from getting repeated. Looking to have it modified in order to stop a
question that has already been answered from appearing again to the user.

2. There is a select box for the user to choose how many questions they want to answer. I'd
like to have some code to be inserted so when the user chooses to answer 5 questions, they get
presented with 5 questions and when they choose to answer 10 questions, they get to answer 10
questions.

3. The showScore function at the end of the quiz has a button "Take another quiz". When clicked,
it's supposed to restart the quiz. It however initially shows a "Next" button which is then
deemed to be the first question thus skewing the results. Would be good to get that resolved.
The problem with the getRandomQuestion() when resolved might do away with this 3rd issue.

Thanks
